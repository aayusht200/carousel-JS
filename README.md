## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a minimal and efficient image carousel using:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for transitions and layout
- JavaScript for slide control

The goal was to create a simple, reusable component that works on any screen size and remains easy to understand and customize.

## Features
- Smooth fade-in / fade-out slide transitions
- Previous and Next navigation buttons
- Fully responsive with a clean aspect-ratio layout
- Customizable through CSS variables
- No external dependencies

## How It Works
The carousel displays one slide at a time. Clicking the navigation buttons moves to the next or previous slide, looping automatically when reaching the beginning or end.

Slides fade in and out using CSS transitions, while JavaScript handles which slide becomes active.

## Project Structure
The project contains:
- An HTML file for markup
- A CSS file for styling
- A JavaScript file for interactivity
- This README

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the HTML file in your browser  
3. The carousel runs immediately—no installation or build tools needed

## Customization
You can personalize the carousel by:
- Adjusting CSS variables
- Adding or removing slides
- Replacing the images
- Restyling buttons or transitions
